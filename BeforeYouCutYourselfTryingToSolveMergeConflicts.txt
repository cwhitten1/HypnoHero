1. Add the following to the end of your git config file: 
	[merge]
    tool = unityyamlmerge

	[mergetool "unityyamlmerge"]
    trustExitCode = false
    cmd = "C:/PROGRA~1/Unity/Editor/Data/Tools/UnityYAMLMerge" merge -p "$BASE" "$REMOTE" "$LOCAL" "$MERGED"

2. Download the Perforce mergetool at https://www.perforce.com/downloads/helix#product-10. You should select the download under HELIX P4MERGE: VISUAL MERGE TOOL

3. Verify that Perforce downloaded into C:\Program Files\Perforce\p4merge.exe

4. Add the following in lines 15-16 of C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Data\Tools\mergespecfile.txt

	unity use "%programs%\Perforce\p4merge.exe" "$BASE" "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE" "$MERGED"
	prefab use "%programs%\Perforce\p4merge.exe" "$BASE" "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE" "$MERGED"

5. When faced with a merge conflict in git that involves a scene or prefab file, run git mergetool. This will call the unity YAML merge tool. 

6. It is possible that the Perforce merge tool may open if there is a conflict that is not a scene file or a prefab file. In this case, you can edit the conflict manually.
